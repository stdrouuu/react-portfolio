## About This Project  
This is my personal portfolio, built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. Although I started with a template, I customized and modified it to suit my own style and content. I changed and adjusted several layouts, and applied different styles on it.


## Vite + React Setup  
Uses a minimal setup to get React working in **Vite**, with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and basic ESLint configuration.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) – uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh  
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) – uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
